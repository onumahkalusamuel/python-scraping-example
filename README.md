# python-scraping-example

This is a very minimal example of webscraper with python, meant for educational purposes.

## Requirements
To test the script, you need `beautiful-soup` and `requests` packages installed on your system.

## Usage
To run the code, use the following command (or modify according to you setup):
```bash
python3 scraper.py
```

This will create a `csv` file in the project folder.
